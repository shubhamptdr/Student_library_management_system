# Student_library_management_system

## Description:

The Student Library Management System is a web-based application built using the Spring Boot framework, MySQL database, 
Hibernate ORM, and JPA (Java Persistence API). The system is designed to manage all library operations, including adding books, 
adding students, issuing and returning books, and locating books in the library.

The application consists of 15+ RESTful APIs that are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. These APIs include obtaining transactions, 
adding books, adding students, locating books, issuing books, and returning books.

The project is structured using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This structure enables
efficient communication between the server and client and streamlines the development process. DTOs are used to transfer data between 
layers, and MVC is used to separate business logic from presentation logic.

The system is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use. It improves the efficiency of library operations and enhances the 
user experience for students and librarians. 
The integration of JPA and Hibernate ORM provides a standard way of managing database persistence and allows for the efficient mapping of 
Java objects to relational data.
